# Time-Series

This code is performing time series analysis on different datasets using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and statsmodels.

The code reads several CSV files containing time series data, preprocesses the data by converting date columns to the datetime format and handling missing values, and then visualizes the time series using line plots.

The autocorrelation of each time series is computed and visualized using autocorrelation plots to determine if there is any significant correlation between data points at different lags.

Additionally, the code calculates the first and second differences of each time series and plots them to visualize the trend, seasonality, and irregular components of the data.

Finally, the code compares the time series data and their differences (i.e., increase and acceleration) to understand the relationships between the variables.

Overall, this code performs a comprehensive analysis of the time series data and provides insights into the trends, seasonality, and patterns of the data.
